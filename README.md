Bro-Chat
========

Bro-Chat (short for Broadcasting-Chat) is a very lightweight chat system.
It is designed to run serverless and with zero configuration. 
Just download and start :-)

Bro-Chat connects you instantly to people in your local network.
It is ideally for LAN-Partys and such stuff.

Other User-Interfaces (Network Interface, Web Interface etc.) will follow.
Next step is TLS encrypted whispering support. (Hopefully tomorrow)

Have fun!
