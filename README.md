Bro-Chat
========

Bro-Chat (short for Broadcasting-Chat) is a very lightweight chat system.
It is designed to run serverless and with zero configuration. 
Just download and start :-)

Bro-Chat connects you instantly to people in your local network.
It is ideally for LAN-Partys and such stuff.

Current User-Interface is a graphical GTK-based UI.
Other User-Interfaces (Network Interface, Web Interface etc.) will follow.
Next step is TLS encrypted whispering and data-transfer support. (Hopefully this week)

Please report any Problems which may occur while using Bro-Chat!

Bro-Chat is principal Arch/OS independent because its written in Go. 
It depends only on Go-Gtk library by mattn (thx!).
If you're able to compile for a specific Arch/OS combination, please commit a binary.

Have fun!
